## submitted on the 20th of April 2025

### Appendix material is available in here
* Appendix 1: List of the biological species considered, with the associated proportion of their geographic distribution areas exposed to metal contamination.
* Appendix 2: List of the biological species affected both by metals (this study) and fire (Feng et al. 2021).
* Appendix 3: Percentage of overlap of the species richness in 10th, 25th and 50th percentile (i.e. hotspot classes) with mining contaminated areas in each biogeographic region. 
* Appendix 4: Maximum range exposure (%) within Indigenous territories.
